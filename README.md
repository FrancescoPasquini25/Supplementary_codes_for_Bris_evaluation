This repository contains a collection of detailed and well-documented Jupyter notebooks designed to support the analysis and results presented in the paper. 
Each notebook is self-contained and independent. All functions and libraries required to run the code and generate the final figure(s) are included within the notebook.
The notebooks serve multiple purposes, including:

i. Evaluating the performance of Bris: a first qualitative general assesment of its predictions and computing the RMSE metric during the occurrence of the Poly storm

ii. The code to study several atmospheric balances and computing the necessary physical quantities: including the Hydrostatic Balance, the Geostrophic Balance, the Gradient Wind Balance in the cyclone's reference framework, the Continuity Equation

iii. The code and computations used to study the fine-scale noise revealed in the Bris outputs, including the spectral analysis and representation of the fields

iv. Generating all the figures included in the paper, providing a clear visual representation of the results and key findings.

You will find 10 different notebooks (used to generate all the 11 figures in the paper), namely,
